## About This Project

This simple demo project was crafted to teach JavaFX. By demonstrating my Java skills and software development best
practices, I hope it can serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in JavaFX. Feel free to explore, learn, and
enjoy!

This project serves as the successor to my previous JavaFX project. For an introduction or a simpler perspective on the concept, feel free to check it out [PhoneBookDemoJavaFX](https://github.com/WebDeveloperALanger/PhoneBookDemoJavaFX).
